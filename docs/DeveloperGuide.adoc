== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

._Architecture Diagram_
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

._Component interactions for `delete 1` command_
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

._Structure of the UI Component_
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
There is also a `ScheduleBox` that is one of the tabs in the TabPane of `MainWindow`, the `ScheduleBox` which inherits from the abstract class `Tabs`. The abstract class `Tabs` also inherits from the abstract class `UiPart`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
._Structure of the Logic Component_
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddMinParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an employee or event).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as adding events and allocating manpower.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

._Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

._Structure of the Model Component_
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Employee Book and Event Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in both `Employee Book` and `Event Book`, which `Employee` can reference. This would allow our application to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

._Structure of the Storage Component_
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the App data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addmin.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Statistics feature
==== Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time and generates statistics via the "statistics /g" command.

Step 2. Statistics are generated on-demand and displayed to the user based on the current data.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How statistics executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate statistics data on-demand, when the user requests.
** Pros: Easier to implement as would not have to mannage storage of statistical data.
** Cons: App may have overall lower performance, with the possibility of lag as the app needs to read
through all the stored data and generate the statistics data whenever it is queried.
* **Alternative 2:** Generate statistics each time there is change in the data and store them.
** Pros: Statistical data will be displayed faster as it is recalculated and stored in the JSON file storage.
** Cons: Requires managing the storage of the statistical data and possibly lead to lowered performance of other features such as the command which does CRUD to Employees/Events which will be slower with the need to generate the statistical data and store it in the JSON file storage.
// end::statistics[]

=== Auto allocation feature
==== Implementation

The `AutoAllocateCommand` has a auto-allocation mechanism which is facilitated by methods in `Event`.
The `AutoAllocateCommand` takes in three arguments:

1.  `eventIndex` - index of event in the displayed event list
2. `ManpowerCountToAdd` - number of employees to allocate [optional]
3. `tagList` - a set of tags to filter the employees [optional]

Additionally, the `AutoAllocateCommand` uses the following operations:

* `Event#isAvailableForEvent()` -- Checks if an employee is available for the event.
* `Event#allocateEmployee()` -- Checks if an employee is available for the event.
* `AutoAllocateCommand#createAvailableEmployeeListForEvent()` -- Creates a list of employees available for the event,
filtered by the tags specified by user.
* `AutoAllocateCommand#getManpowerNeededByEvent()` -- Calculates the number of employees currently required
by the event.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the auto allocation mechanism behaves at each step.

._Program flow of the Auto Allocate Feature_
image::AutoAllocateFlowChart.png[]

**Step 1**. The user executes `allocate 1 n/2 t/female` with the intention to allocate 2 employees with tag [female]
to the 1st event displayed in the event list.

**Step 2**. The command checks if `eventIndex` is valid and if `ManpowerCountToAdd` is specified.
[NOTE]
If `ManpowerCountToAdd` is not specified, it is assumed to be the maximum number possible for the event.
Validity of other command arguments e.g. if `ManpowerCountToAdd` is a positive integer is checked
by `AutoAllocateCommandParser` and not within the command `AutoAllocateCommand`.


**Step 3**. The command calls its own method `AutoAllocateCommand#getManpowerNeededByEvent()` to get the number of employees
required by the specified event.


**Step 4**. The command calls its own method `AutoAllocateCommand#createAvailableEmployeeListForEvent()` to create a
filtered list of employees based on the `tagList` and if employee satisfies `Event#isAvailableForEvent()`.

**Step 5**. The command checks if supply (number of employees in filtered list in step 4) exceeds
demand (number of employees required by event, generated in step 3).
[NOTE]
If supply < demand, throws exception to user. If supply > demand, employees will be randomly selected instead.

**Step 6**. The command calls `Event#allocateEmployee()` to allocate the chosen employees to the event.

[NOTE]
For storage purposes, only the `Employee#EmployeeId` is allocated to the event.

**Step 7**. Done.


The following sequence diagram shows how the auto allocation works:

._Sequence Diagram of the AutoAllocate Command_
image::AutoAllocateSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AutoAllocateCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user successfully executes a `AutoAllocateCommand`:

._Activity Diagram of the AutoAllocate Command_
image::AutoAllocateActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of employees associated with event after successful command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves only the `Employee#EmployeeId` associated with the event.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Will use less memory.
** Cons: Future accesses require more time.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves all fields of `Employee` associated with the event..
** Pros: Easy retrieval in the future.
** Cons: Changes in `Employee` attributes have to be reflected in the event. This meant that `EditCommand` and
`DeleteCommand` have to be heavily modified.

===== Aspect: Allocation of manpower when demand exceeds supply.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Throws exception
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons:
* **Alternative 2:** Allocate the current available employees
** Pros:
** Cons: Testability issues.
// end::allocate[]

// tag::test[]
=== Setting Date & Time to Events
==== Implementation
The `Event` object is constructed with a start date and an end date as class attributes, both of which are `EventDate` objects, which represents a single day by itself.
Our implementation of `Event` does not assume that the event will be occurring consecutively from the start to the end date, and requires the user to manually assign each specific date with the time period that the Event is in process.

To achieve this functionality, there exists an `EventDayTime` object that encapsulates the period of the day.
It has two class attributes - both of which are `LocalTime` objects to represent the start and end time.

Each Event contains an `EventDateTimeMap` object that maps an `EventDate` object to an `EventDayTime` object using a HashMap implementation.
This mapping is added through the `EventAssignDate` command.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the program functionality when a user attempts to assign a Date & Time to an already existent Event.

. The User executes the command `set_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019 time/0900-2000`, with the intention to assign the date of 18th October 2019, time period 9am-8pm to the second event currently displayed in the event list.
. The parser checks if input format is correct, and attempts to create `Index`, `EventDate` and `EventDayTime` objects from it
. The command checks if the index of the event stated exists on the displayed list, and if the stated date is within the start and end date of the Event. (Input Validation)
. The command calls `Event#assignDateTime()` on the referenced Event object to add the EventDate-EventDayTime mapping into `EventDateTimeMap`.
. Storage is updated.
. Done.

[NOTE]
If the command execution fails, a `ParseException` (from Step 2) or a `CommandException` (from Step 3) will be thrown, specifiying the reason of the error.

The following activity diagram shows how the Setting of Date&Time to Event work:

._Activity Diagram of the SettingEventDate Command_
image::SettingEventDateActivityDiagram.png[SettingEvent,295,607]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Storage of DateTimeMap

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the DateTimeMap in an array format that is saved in `eventbook.json`
** Pros: Simplicity in implementation and easier reference as it is loaded and saved to the same JSON file.
** Cons: Performance issues as it needs to update the entire event object although only one attribute is updated
* **Alternative 2:** Store the DateTimeMap in a separate file e.g. `EventDateTimes.json` that will be referenced by EventBook during initialization.
** Pros: Faster performance in saving and loading as it is kept separate from `eventbook.json` and hence will not
** Cons: Requires a new storage unit, along with all its supporting functions which will require alot of repeated code.
Instantiation of the `Event` object when the app is started will be more complicated as well due to the need to read from two separate files

* **Decision:** Alternative 1
** Alternative 2 would make sense if our app is utilizing a DBMS and it would be a best practice to separate the information.
However, as we are constrained with not utilizing a DBMS, Alternative 1 is a logically simpler and more efficent solution from a software engineering standpoint.

// tag::displayschedule[]
=== [Proposed] Display Schedule feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The Display Schedule Feature is implemented to allow users to view all dates and the specific events for those dates listed.
The feature is facilitated by a `DistinctDatesProcessor` and requires the use of a new Object - `DistinctDate`, as well as
an internal ObservableList - `distinctDatesList` found in the `ModelManager`.

It processes the entire list of Events in the `EventList` when the command is called. The `DistinctDateProcessor` will then
process through these events to create specific `DistinctDate` Objects which stores a list of events which occurs on the date
they are representing. These DistinctDate Objects are then used to be represented on the GUI.

Additionally, The DistinctDateProcessor contains the following operations:

* `generateDistinctDateList(Model model)` -- Returns a list of `DistinctDate` Objects. This operation utilises the generateDateList() and generateListOfEventForDate() operations.
* `generateListOfEventForDate(LocalDate date, Model model)` -- Takes in a `LocalDate` object, and processes through the entire list of events, to find all events on that specific date, and return them as a list.
* `generateDateList(Model model)` -- Takes in the entire list of events, identify all the dates that has at least one event and returns it as a list.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `distinctDatesList` will be initialized based on the initial event book state.

image::DisplayScheduleState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `add_ev n/Free Cofee ...` to add a new event into the list. The distinctDatesList will be flushed.

image::DisplayScheduleState1.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command that alters the eventBook will cause the distinctDatesList to be flushed. User will be required to input "display_schedule" command again to generate the new list of schedule.

Step 3. The user executes `display_schedule` to see all dates and the respective events on those dates. The distinctDateList will be generated again based on the current list of events in the EventList.

image::DisplayScheduleState2.png[]


Step 4. The user now decides to close the app, the current state of the EventBook and EmployeeBook will be stored, however the DistinctDateList would not.

image::DisplayScheduleState3.png[]

[NOTE]
Note that the Display Schedule Feature does not load and store the DistinctDate Objects. It processes and generates the list when it is called upon or when the application starts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

._Sequence Diagram for DisplaySchedule Command_
image::DisplayScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DisplayScheduleCommand` ends at the destroy marker (X).

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Display Schedule executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generates and Processes the DistinctDate Object upon start up and command call.
** Pros: Easy to implement and requires less Storage Capacity.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed and time Complexity. The program will have to iterate through the entire list of events, whenever display_schedule command is called.
* **Alternative 2:** Creates and Stores the DistinctDate object whenever a new event is added.
** Pros: Will require less processing, Do not have to create a new list of DistinctDate object everytime it is called
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of Storage needed, requires new storage unit to store a new entity which is not as important.
Can cause speed and time complexity issues as well, Whenever edits are made to the existing eventList - add_ev, delete_ev etc
the program is required to process through all DistinctDate Object to make the neccesary changes.

* **Decision:** Alternative 1
** Alternative 1 makes more logical sense and will be more efficient as compared to Alternative 2. Alternative 1 requires less intermediate processing and storage units to support the feature.
Processing is only done when it is needed.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
