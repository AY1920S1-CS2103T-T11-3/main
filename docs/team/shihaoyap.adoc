== PROJECT: AddMin+ - All in one administration desktop application

---

== Overview on Project

AddMin+ is student developed application for a school project (CS2103T). The project requires us to enhance a basic command line
interface desktop application which is the `AddressBook - Level 3` that was developed by the se-edu team. The
`AddressBook - Level 3` is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

== About AddMin+

The AddMin+ Team is made up of 5 Computer science students from AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3. The team decided to morph and enhance
the capabilities of the original application into an All in one administration desktop application. The application is specially
designed for the use of any events management start-up company with limited manpower and resources.

AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of the admin staffs in these companies and allow him/her to
effectively handle the administrative tasks of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and
deletion, editing of event details after creation, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an
overview of all the data via statistics while keeping track of the companies schedule to ensure that no event is missed!

This is what AddMin+ looks like:

My role was to design and write codes for the entire `Schedule` section of the project. The following sections will illustrate
the enhancements in more detail, as well as provide relevant documentation that i have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to those enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this documents:

== Summary of contributions
This section will show a summary of all the features, enhancements, documentations, and other useful contributions that i have
contributed to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added and implemented the entire *Schedule* section of the project which includes major GUI implementations
and 3 schedule related features.
** What it does: The *Schedule* section was implemented to allow users to have an easier way to view and identify
the events that are going on a specific date, period. Thus, the `display_schedule_date` and `display_schedule` feature was implemented.
The enhancement was also done to improve the user experience, by providing a clean graphical representation of the user's specified
schedule, which could be seen from the *Schedule* tab and the window generated by the `generate_schedule` feature.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to have a convenient way to view their upcoming
event schedule and keep track of all the event dates. This feature will greatly increase the user experience of the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires the event objects extensively. The implementation of the *Schedule* features required an in-depth
analysis of the application's storage architecture and modeling. The implementation of *Schedule* was also challenging as it required the
implementation of an additional `DistinctDate` object for the `generate_schedule` feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: minor Graphic User Interface changes to improve the user experience of the application.
