== Welcome to AddMin+

== Overview on Project

AddMin+ is a student developed application under the National University of Singapore's __CS2103T Software Engineering Module__.
The project required students to enhance a basic command-line interface desktop application which is the
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3]
that was developed by the se-edu team. The
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3]
is a desktop address book application that was designed to be used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

== About AddMin+

The AddMin+ Team comprises of 5 Computer science students from AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3. The team decided to
morph and enhance the capabilities of the original application into an all-in-one administration desktop
application. The application is specially designed for the use of any events management start-up company
that is faced with limited manpower and resources.

AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of admin staff in these companies and allow them to
effectively handle the administrative needs of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and
deletion, editing of event details, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an
overview of all important data for the administrator via statistical representation.

Below is an image of what AddMin+ displays to the user upon starting up.

== My Roles and Responsibilities
My project responsibilities and tasking include being in charge of the group's code quality via testing and finding bugs in the application.

While my coding related tasking was focused on designing and writing codes for the entire *Statistics* section of the project. The following sections will illustrate the enhancements in more detail, as well as provide relevant documentation that I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to those enhancements.

== Before we start
The following symbols and formatting will be used throughout this document:

[TIP]
*LightBulbs* indicate a _Tip_, something that is helpful to the reader

[NOTE]
*'i' Icon* indicate a _Note_ that supplements useful information

Text in a link:[`blue font and grey`] background indicates a _hyperlink_

Texts with a `grey background` indicates _Code Logic_ such as class objects, OOP definitions or user-input.


== Summary of contributions
This section will show a summary of all the features, enhancements, documentation, and other useful contributions
that I have contributed to the team project.

* *Major feature*: Implemented the entire *Statistics* segment of the project which includes major GUI modifications and 3 statistics related user commands.

** What does it do: The *Statistics* section was implemented to allow users to have an overview of their app data, specifically on the employee and events. Thus, the `statistics`, `generate_stats` and `generate_stats_detail` commands were implemented. The `statistics` command or clicking the Statistics tab enables the user to enter the statistics mode to be able to use the other two statistics command. The `generate_stats` command or clicking the Generate Statistics button signals the app to generate a statistical representation based on the current data. The `generate_stats_detail` command or clicking the Generate Detailed Statistics button signals the app to generate a text-based detailed statistics based on the current data. 

** Justification: The *Statistics* feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to have a convenient way to view their events and employees data, specifically their tags. For an events administrator, it is important that they find the appropriate manpower to allocate to each event and the pie chart representation of the tags allows the user to determine quicly if they have the appropriate manpower available for the upcoming event or will they require more manpower.

** Highlights: This enhancement required handling and dealing with both the `Employee` and `Event` objects. The implementation of the *Statistics* feature required an in-depth analysis of how the program deals with storage and retrieval of these objects while the app is running. The *Statistics* feature was also challenging as it was important to make the statistics displayed useful and relevant to the user. During the designing of the *Statistics* component, deep consideration was needed to ensure that the user interface was clean and optimal for the users, therefore, it was decided that pie charts would be a suitable visual representation for the employee and event tags data.

* *Minor features*: Implemented the delete command to remove events easily via the `delete_ev #index` commands based on the current list displayed on the User Interface and the list command to display both employee and events via the 'list' command. User Interface modifications were also done to provide intuitive user experience through simplicity.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=eshwarkp&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=shihaoyap&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[tp Code Dashboard]]

=== Statistics

==== Generate Statistics: `generate_stats`

Displays a set of statistics, Number of events, Number of employee etc

Format: `generate_stats`

**Example: To generate list and pie chart statistics on demand.**

**Step 1**.
Navigate to the statistics tab either using the mouse to click the statistics tab or by typing `statistics` command.

image::StatsUiPart0.png[]

**Step 2**.
Generate the statistics either by using the mouse to click the generate statistics button or by typing `generate_stats` command.

image::StatsUiPart1.png[]

**Step 3**.
Statistics will be displayed in 2 different types of views: list and pie chart.
The list will display the upcoming events that require manpower sorted from the nearest upcoming date to the furthest date.
The pie charts represent the upcoming events that require manpower and employees tags respectively. This is done this way to help the user identify efficiently if they have sufficient employees with matching tags for the event or if more employees may need to be hired to match the tag of the upcoming event.
For example, a music event will have a 'music' tag and an employee who plays the guitar will have a 'musician' tag.
The pie charts will reflect that there is one event under the 'music' tag and one employee under the 'musician' tag.

image::StatsUiPart2.png[]

**Step 4**.
To allocate an employee to an upcoming event, double-click the event on the list and it will display the allocate function covered earlier in the User Guide.
The segments on the pie charts can also be clicked to display the number of events or employees associated with that specific tag on the top right corner of each of the pie charts.

image::StatsUiPart3.png[]

**Step 5**.
Generate statistics manually when any change in data occurs to keep the statistics up to date and relevant.

image::StatsUiPart4.png[]

==== Generate Detailed Statistics: `generate_stats_detail`

Displays a set of statistics, Number of events, Number of employee etc

Format: `generate_stats_detail`

**Example: To generate detailed statistics in plain text format on demand.**

**Step 1**.
Either type `generate_stats_detail` into the command box or navigate to the statistics tab and click the 'Generate Detailed Statistics' button.

image::StatsUiPart5.png[]

**Step 2**.
A pop-up window with the header "StatisticsWindow" will appear displaying statistics for both employees and events.

== Conclusion:
The AddMin+ project was created by the AddMin+ Team as part of a university module requirement. Through AddMin+, I was able
to experience what it was like to be involved in a software development project, where we were able to experience both the technical and
non-technical aspects of a software development project. We were able to directly apply the key software development concepts taught in CS2103T
in our project and also experience what it was like dealing with a brown-field project.

Another aspect of software development which I felt is often overlooked is actually the non-technical aspect, such as
documentation writing. However, through CS2101, we were able to learn the steps of writing quality documentation of our project
that caters to our target audiences. Finally, even though the AddMin+ project was only 6 weeks long, I was able to pick up many valuable knowledge
that will be essential in becoming a software developer in the future. If you would like to know more about me or AddMin+, feel free to drop by my https://shihaoyap.github.io/ShihaoResume/index.html[personal website] or
