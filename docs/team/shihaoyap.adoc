== PROJECT: AddMin+ - All in one administration desktop application

---

== Overview on Project

AddMin+ is student developed application for a school project (CS2103T). The project requires us to enhance a basic command line
interface desktop application which is the `AddressBook - Level 3` that was developed by the se-edu team. The
`AddressBook - Level 3` is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

== About AddMin+

The AddMin+ Team is made up of 5 Computer science students from AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3. The team decided to morph and enhance
the capabilities of the original application into an all-in-one administration desktop application. The application is specially
designed for the use of any events management start-up company with limited manpower and resources.

AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of admin staffs in these companies and allow them to
effectively handle the administrative needs of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and
deletion, editing of event details after creation, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an
overview of all the data via statistics while keeping track of the companies schedule to ensure that no event is missed!

This is what AddMin+ looks like:

My project responsibilities and tasking includes being in charge of the group's documentation quality as
well as ensure project deliverable are done on time and in the right format.

While my coding related role was to design and write codes for the entire `Schedule` section of the project.
The following sections will illustrate the enhancements in more detail, as well as provide relevant
documentation that i have added to the user and developer guides in relation to those enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this documents:
[TIP]
*LightBulbs* indicate a _Tip_, something that is helpful to the reader

[NOTE]
*'i' Icon* indicate a _Note_ that supplements useful information

Text in a link:[`blue font and grey`] background indicates a _hyperlink_

Text with a `grey background` indicates _Code Logic_ such as class objects, OOP definitions or user-input.


== Summary of contributions
This section will show a summary of all the features, enhancements, documentations, and other useful contributions
that i have contributed to the team project.

* *Major feature*: added and implemented the entire *Schedule* section of the project which includes major GUI implementations
and 3 schedule related features.
** What it does: The *Schedule* section was implemented to allow users to have an easier way to view and identify
the events that are going on a specific date, period. Thus, the `display_schedule_date` and `display_schedule` feature was implemented.
The enhancement was also done to improve the user experience, by providing a clean graphical representation of the user's specified
schedule, which could be seen from the *Schedule* tab and the window generated by the `generate_schedule` feature.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to have a convenient way to view their upcoming
event schedule and keep track of all the event dates. The feature will greatly increase the user experience of the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires handling and dealing with the event objects extensively. The implementation of the *Schedule* features
required an in-depth analysis of the application's storage architecture and modeling. The implementation of *Schedule* was also challenging as
it required the implementation of an additional `DistinctDate` object for the `generate_schedule` feature. During the designing of the *Schedule*
component, deep consideration was needed to ensure that the user interface was clean and optimal for the users.

* *Minor features*: Multiple Graphic User Interface improvements throughout the application to improve the user experience.
As well as optimising user experience by enabling the tab recognition feature, where AddMin+ is able to identify which tab
the user is on. This feature allows AddMin+ to bring users to the correct tab when a user inputs a command. It also
enables AddMin+ to recognise which list the user is trying to edit on, and react accordingly. Implemented the Add and
Edit event commands for AddMin+. Implemented the find_em_tag and find_ev_tag command of AddMin+.
