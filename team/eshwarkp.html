<div class="paragraph">
<p>AddMin+ is a student developed application under the National University of Singapore&#8217;s <em>CS2103T Software Engineering Module</em>.
The project required students to enhance a basic command-line interface desktop application which is the
<a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">AddressBook - Level 3</a>
that was developed by the se-edu team. The
<a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">AddressBook - Level 3</a>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AddMin+ Team comprises of 5 Computer science students from AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3. The team decided to
morph and enhance the capabilities of the original application into an all-in-one administration desktop
application. The application is specially designed for the use of any events management start-up company
that is faced with limited manpower and resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of admin staff in these companies and allow them to
effectively handle the administrative needs of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and
deletion, editing of event details, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an
overview of all important data for the administrator via statistical representation.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major feature</strong>: Implemented the entire <strong>Statistics</strong> segment of the project which includes major GUI modifications and 3 statistics related user commands.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does it do: The <strong>Statistics</strong> section was implemented to allow users to have an overview of their app data, specifically on the employee and events. Thus, the <code>statistics</code>, <code>generate_stats</code> and <code>generate_stats_detail</code> commands were implemented. The <code>statistics</code> command or clicking the Statistics tab enables the user to enter the statistics mode to be able to use the other two statistics command. The <code>generate_stats</code> command or clicking the Generate Statistics button signals the app to generate a statistical representation based on the current data. The <code>generate_stats_detail</code> command or clicking the Generate Detailed Statistics button signals the app to generate a text-based detailed statistics based on the current data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: The <strong>Statistics</strong> feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to have a convenient way to view their events and employees data, specifically their tags. For an events administrator, it is important that they find the appropriate manpower to allocate to each event and the pie chart representation of the tags allows the user to determine quicly if they have the appropriate manpower available for the upcoming event or will they require more manpower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement required handling and dealing with both the <code>Employee</code> and <code>Event</code> objects. The implementation of the <strong>Statistics</strong> feature required an in-depth analysis of how the program deals with storage and retrieval of these objects while the app is running. The <strong>Statistics</strong> feature was also challenging as it was important to make the statistics displayed useful and relevant to the user. During the designing of the <strong>Statistics</strong> component, deep consideration was needed to ensure that the user interface was clean and optimal for the users, therefore, it was decided that pie charts would be a suitable visual representation for the employee and event tags data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor features</strong>: Implemented the delete command to remove events easily via the <code>delete_ev #index</code> commands based on the current list displayed on the User Interface and the list command to display both employee and events via the 'list' command. User Interface modifications were also done to provide intuitive user experience through simplicity.</p>

Statistics will be displayed in 2 different types of views: list and pie chart.
The list will display the upcoming events that require manpower sorted from the nearest upcoming date to the furthest date.
The pie charts represent the upcoming events that require manpower and employees tags respectively. This is done this way to help the user identify efficiently if they have sufficient employees with matching tags for the event or if more employees may need to be hired to match the tag of the upcoming event.
For example, a music event will have a 'music' tag and an employee who plays the guitar will have a 'musician' tag.
The pie charts will reflect that there is one event under the 'music' tag and one employee under the 'musician' tag.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="link" href="#conclusion">Conclusion:</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conclusion, the AddMin+ application was developed
in conjunction with the CS2103T and CS2101 modules offered
by the School of Computing. The process of going through each stage
of the software development lifecycle has been a valuable and unique
experience for all of us. Being students, many of us are yet to have
experienced how software engineering is done in the industry and
these modules have given us an early insight on what to expect in the
future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personally, one of the biggest challenges I faced while undertaking CS2103T,
was the developing of code on top an existing code base. The process of
understanding what has been done so far before building on top of that
is tedious and takes a fair amount of time. However, it has helped me learn
that software engineering is not only about writing code but more of a form
of communication between people and I can see now that it is important that I
understand what other engineers are trying to say before I perform my tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the code, I have also been exposed to the importance of being able to
communicate on a human level through the CS2101 module. Although the scope of
the software engineer is to develop code, I have learnt that there is much more
to building a product than just coding. Connecting with others eventually plays
a big part on whether or not a product is able to launch and stay successful.</p>
