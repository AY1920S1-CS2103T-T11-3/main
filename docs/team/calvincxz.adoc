== PROJECT: AddMin+

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an employee records management
cum communication system called AddMin+. This enhanced application enables office managers to file and recall employee
data; manage employee work schedule and leave application;
and email employees directly without opening an email application.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write the codes for the fetch and allocate features. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *automated allocation of employees to event commands* with *GUI feature*
** What it does: allows the user to allocate employees to an event with certain filter requirements.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now associate employees
with events. The GUI feature further provides convenience for users.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it
required significant changes to both `Event` and `Employee` classes.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a *fetch_ev* command that allows the user to view more details about a specified event.
The GUI feature allows users to simply double-click an event to execute this command. This GUI enhancement is complementary
to the *automated allocation* feature previously mentioned.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Ensured integration of various components (e.g. storage, logic, model) during the morphing phase.
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated GUI to show both employee and event list
*** Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
