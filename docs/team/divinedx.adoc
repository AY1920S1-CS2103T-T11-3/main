== PROJECT: AddMin+

---

== Overview of Project

AddMin+ is student developed application under the National University of Singapore's __CS2103T Software Engineering Module__. In this module, we were organized to a team of 5 members for the software engineering project. The project requires us to enhance a basic command line interface desktop application, the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3] developed by the https://se-education.org/[se-edu team] for the the purpose of teaching Software Engineering principles.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the *`Event` Component*, and most significantly the *Event Date-Time Mapping and its ancillaries*
** What it does: The `Event` Component features basic __Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)__ functionality, extended with the ability to store a list of `Employees` in a Manpower List and a Date-Time Map that stores the schedule of the `Event`. The Date-Time Mapping feature enables the user to accurately and precisely map a schedule of an existing `Event`, broken down into its individual dates and time period.

** Justification: The `Event` Component is critical for our application's functionality as its target audience is Administrative Staff in small companies managing events. Having a known date-time schedule of each `Event` supports the ability for administrative matters such as manpower allocation and schedule generation, ensuring that the employees are allocated to events efficiently without overlaps/conflicts in schedule.

** Highlights: This Date-Time Mapping feature is significant and is required for two other significant features of our application, manpower allocation and scheduling. To enhance the user experience and achieve our goal of simplifying tedious administrative work, we included methods for __quick assignment__ of dates and time. Overall, the implementation was challenging as I also needed to consider how edits to the start/end dates of the `Event` may break the manpower allocation or assigned date-time mapping and deal with them accordingly.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the *Fetch Employee* Command
** What it does: Shows the schedule of a single `Employee`, which displays a list of dates which itslf contains a list of `Event` that the `Employee` is allocated to.

** Justification: It would be useful for either the adminstrative staff or the employee to view the current schedule of an `Employee` for tracking and logging purposes.
