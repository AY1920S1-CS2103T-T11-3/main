== PROJECT: AddMin+

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a all-in-one administration
desktop application called AddMin+.

AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of the admin staffs in these companies and allow him/her to
effectively handle the administrative tasks of the company.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write the codes for the association of employees with event, which includes the
event display and the allocation of employee to event. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added features to allow association of employees with events which includes
*automated/manual allocation of employees to event commands* and a *deallocate command*, as well as the
viewing of changes the users made via the *fetch event* command. All related commands have *GUI features* implemented.

** What it does: allows the user to check for availability of employees and allocate them to an event with
certain filter requirements. The algorithm ensures that employees cannot be allocated to events with
conflicting time periods.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now allocate employees
to events, which is a key component for events management companies that our app is targeting.
The GUI features further provide convenience for users.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it
required the knowledge of both `Event` and `Employee` classes.

* *Minor enhancement*: added command history to allow user to view previous commands using up/down
arrow keys.
